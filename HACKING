This file describes the coding style I prefer for the panel. If you want to
help out with panel development, please try to conform to these 'rules'.

Nick prefers to align variable declarations, so here is an updated set of rules:

- Coding style:
  o Indentation is 4 spaces. Expand tabs, i.e. only use spaces for indentation.
  o Braces are on a new line. For one-line if statements braces may be omitted.
  o Return type of function definitions on a separate line.
  o Function arguments on separate lines with the same alignment rules as 
    variable declarations.
  o Variable declarations are aligned on the variable name. Short variable 
    declarations may be combined. Example:

    static gboolean
    example_function (GtkWidget *widget,
                      Panel     *panel,
                      int        value)
    {
        XfceHandleType  type;
        const char     *string;
        int             important_value;
        int             i, n, x, y;
        /* ... */
    }

  o In header files and for static prototypes, you may align functions names as
    well as arguments. No need to limit the line length. Example:

    static gboolean     xfce_panel_long_name_for_example_function        (GtkWidget  *widget,
                                                                          Panel      *panel,
                                                                          int         value);

    static void         example_function_2                               (Panel      *panel,
                                                                          const char *value);

- ChangeLog: I use the svn2cl package to create the changelog from the SVN log
  messages. 
  o Website: http://ch.tudelft.nl/~arthur/svn2cl/ . 
  o Current version: 0.8. 
  o Command line: svn2cl.sh --linelen=74 --break-before-msg .
  Note: I don't care about linelen, but with this parameter the changes with
        previous ChangeLog were smallest.

- Patches: use 'svn diff' to create patches if possible, or 'diff -u'.

- If you have SVN access it is ok to commit trivial changes directly, but 
  please send a patch to the mailing list for discussion for any non-trivial
  or non-obvious changes.

- As an exception to the rule above, if you are managing an Xfce release, feel 
  free to do anything you need to achieve that goal.

- Managing the po/ directory, including the ChangeLog found there is left 
  completely in the hands of the Xfce Translation Team.
