against the Git master branch are most preferable. You can always

Coding Style
============

 - Always expand tabs, so the code is not dependent from a gives tab
   setting.
 - Braces are on a new line. For one-line if statements braces may be omitted.
 - Return type of function definitions on a separate line.
 - Function arguments on separate lines with the same alignment rules as 
   variable declarations.
 - Use 3 empty lines between functions.
 - Variable declarations are aligned on the variable name. Short variable 
   declarations may be combined. Example:

   static gboolean
   example_function (GtkWidget *widget,
                     Panel     *panel,
                     gint       value)
   {
       XfceHandleType  type;
       const gchar    *string;
       gint            important_value;
       gint            i, n, x, y;
       /* ... */
   }

 - In header files and for static prototypes, you may align functions names as
   well as arguments. No need to limit the line length. Example:

    static gboolean    xfce_panel_long_name_for_example_function    (GtkWidget   *widget,
                                                                     Panel       *panel,
                                                                     gint         value);
    static void        example_function_2                           (Panel       *panel,
                                                                     const gchar *value);
 - Write ChangeLog entries.


ChangeLogs
==========

We use the logs produced by git.


Misc
====
- If you have Git access it is ok to commit trivial changes directly, but 
  please send a patch to the mailing list for discussion for any non-trivial
  or non-obvious changes.
- As an exception to the rule above, if you are managing an Xfce release, feel 
  free to do anything you need to achieve that goal.
- Managing the po/ directory, including the ChangeLog found there is left 
  completely in the hands of the Xfce Translation Team.
