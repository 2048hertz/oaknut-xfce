Things to do and ideas for Xfce Panel
=====================================

Pick From Trunk
---------------
 - DND to launcher, bug 3958.
 - Merge translation changes (r29176, r29084, r29082).
 - Add the new panel icons from trunk.

General
-------
 - Fix all the code with TODO in the comment.
 - Add some lines in README.
 - Xfconf locking for kiosk (insensitive/hidden widget if locked).

Libxfce4panel
-------------
 - Add style property to the scaled image to fix to a default size
   or use all the available area.
 - Launcher and iconbox buttons with only icons so it looks nice with
   a transparant panel.
 - Implement screen-position again.

Panel
-----
 - Stack panels on screen edges.
 - Support for remote plugins.
 - Implement settings manager as socket to integrate with xfce4-settings.
 - Make panel positioning work in various kinds of monitor layouts.

Systray
-------
 - Transparent tray icons (Fixed in Gtk+?).
 - Option to 'disable' tray icons instead of hiding them.
 - Use libnotify (dbus api?) for systray notifications, currently the 
   code is disabled.
