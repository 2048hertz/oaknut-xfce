TODO
----
* gtk widgets (panel, controls)
  - include move handles (steal code form GtkHandlebox)
  - use properties and signals for settings
  - perhaps use interfaces or derived widgets for controls
* unload unused plugins
* plugin library
  - with API docs
* smarter resize/move
  - popup arrow direction
  - keep panel on same x/y alignment
* multiple panels
  - Most settings should become per panel
* use icon theme spec
* drag to add/remove
* drag to move
* taskbar == panel instance?
* Move the exec_cmd stuff to libxfce4util/libxfcegui4

Ideas
-----
* plugins:
  - dockapps support
  - iconbox / task list
* Move to glib xml parsing. More work, but more speed / 
  reduced memory usage
* 2 plugins side by side 
   (like systembuttons)
