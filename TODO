TODO list for xfce4
===================

Major features for 4.0
----------------------
* write user docs				STARTED
* provide good default configuration

Nice to have for 4.0
--------------------
* more themes: Night, KDE, Next, WindowsXP, BeOS, ...
  (not too many released with xfce4; < 10)

After 4.0 
------------------------------------
* make panel a gtk widget
  - include move handles (steal code form GtkHandlebox)
  - use properties and signals for settings
* make controls / control classes a widget or gobject
  - use refcounting on classes to load / unload modules
  - perhaps using a timeout
  - perhaps use interfaces or derived widgets for controls
* plugins:
  - volume control plugin (DONE)
  - notification area plugin (as used by GNOME and KDE)
    This would be really cool! (DONE)
  - dockapps support
* allow hiding of all popup buttons
* write API docs for plugin writers
* new dialog for panel controls (treeview with dialog area)
  adding/removing controls from here.
* Move to glib xml parsing. More work, but more speed / reduced memory usage
* IMPORTANT: Move the exec_cmd stuff to libxfce4util/libxfcegui4 and
  unify the interface!
