TODO
----
* Fix gettext issues so I don't have to use a special
  #define dg_(s)  dgettext (PACKAGE, s)
  Somehow PACKAGE_GETTEXT is set to something else ...
* plugin library
  - with API docs
* multiple panels
  - Most settings should become per panel
  - multiscreen
  - taskbar == panel instance?
* beter DND support
  - add/remove
  - move
* gtk widgets (panel, controls)
  - [DONE] include move handles (steal code form GtkHandlebox)
  - use properties and signals for settings
  - perhaps use interfaces or derived widgets for controls

Ideas
-----
* plugins:
  - dockapps support
* 2 plugins side by side 
   (like systembuttons)
