TODO list for xfce4
===================

Major features for 4.0
----------------------
* provide good default configuration


After 4.0 
------------------------------------
* make panel a gtk widget
  - include move handles (steal code form GtkHandlebox)
  - use properties and signals for settings

* do something smart with the panel behaviour depending on its position
  - hiding
  - popup arrow direction
  - idea: keep panel on same alignment percentage (O% left aligned, 50%
    centered, 100% right aligned).
  - be a bit smarter when changing panel size (eg, keep at edge).

* Allow multiple panels?
  - seriously look at mcs plugin. Most settings should become per panel
    instead of global.

* make controls / control classes a widget or gobject
  - use refcounting on classes to load / unload modules
  - perhaps using a timeout
  - perhaps use interfaces or derived widgets for controls
  
* plugins:
  - dockapps support
  - iconbox / task list
  
* write API docs for plugin writers

* new dialog for panel controls (treeview with dialog area)
  adding/removing controls from here.
  
* Move to glib xml parsing. More work, but more speed / reduced memory usage

* IMPORTANT: Move the exec_cmd stuff to libxfce4util/libxfcegui4 and
  unify the interface!
