TODO list for xfce4
===================

Major features for 4.0
----------------------
* port to global settings manager system	DONE
* write user docs				STARTED
* provide good default configuration
* finish info panel text ad credits		STARTED

Nice to have for 4.0
--------------------
* more themes: Night, KDE, Next, WindowsXP, BeOS, ...
  (not too many released with xfce4; < 10)
* snap panel to corners and center of screen edges

After 4.0 
------------------------------------
* volume control plugin
* notification area plugin (as used by GNOME and KDE). 
  This would be really cool!
* dockapps support
* swallow apps
* hide popup buttons
* write API docs for plugin writers		
* new dialog for panel controls (treeview with dialog area)
  adding/removing controls from here.
