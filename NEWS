Panel
=====
- Almost complete rewrite of the code. Everything is now writtin in gobjects and a lot easier to understand (more comments, better function names, less code, smarter, faster, etc.).
- Dragging a panel to snap to screen egdes (will work on a mouseless implementation later). Greatly improved the positioning code.
- You can set the panel length (percentages).
- Lock panels -> no dragging possible.
- Alpha background (transparent panel).
- Item/plugin editor in the panel preferences.
- Xfconf, so you can change all panel properties externally except for adding and removing panels (yet).

Plugin Framework
================
- ALL PLUGINS ARE FROM NOW ON COMPILED AS LIBRARIES. So you need to change your Makefile.am (sorry). Will provide a script to do this before compiling a plugin.
- DBus communication with external plugins.
- Plugins API is still the same (pfew).
- If you want to run an external plugin you can define X-XFCE-External=TRUE in the desktop file. The panel will then start a plugin wrapper that embeds the plugin, so you have all the advanatages of the previous external plugin implementation (and I get something that is easy to maintain).
- Because of the changes above, the XfcePanelPlugin is now a single gobject, this drops a lot of complexity in the previous plugin framework and also allows developing plugins as gobjects (yay).
- Various speedups here and there.

Internal Plugins
================
- Xfconf support in all plugins.
- All plugins use the gobject implementation.
- Iconbox: Merged in the tasklist plugins.
- Clock: Fuzzy clock mode. Still working on some other improvements.
- Tasklist: Dropped the WnckTasklist, to make the iconbox merge. Also working on some other improvements (sorting, dnd, performance, accessibility).
- Launcher: Improve desktop file support, not started yet. In the end it should be a lot easier to create launchers.
- Launcher: Create new launchers from the command line.
