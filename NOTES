Developer notes:
----------------

	* I18n: Do NOT ever edit the po/Makefile.in.in or run glib-gettextize
	  or gettextize in this directory, as it'll break the locales
	  install stuff. If you think you need to change something,
	  ask Benedikt Meurer first (benedikt.meurer@unix-ag.uni-siegen.de).

	* Theres now a xfce4-panel-1.0.pc file for use with external panel
	  plugins. In addition the panel header files are now installed into
	  $(includedir)/xfce4/panel, so if you want to use them in your
	  code, refer to them as <panel/whatever.h>.
	  To compile a panel plugin add the output of
	  
	  	pkg-config --cflags xfce4-panel-1.0
	
	  to your CFLAGS and the output of
	  
	  	pkg-config --libs xfce4-panel-1.0
	
	  to your LIBS. The plugin needs to be installed into the panels
	  plugin in order to be found by the panel. To get the path to
	  the plugins directory use the following command:

	  	pkg-config --variable=pluginsdir xfce4-panel-1.0

	  Have fun with writing new panel plugins.
