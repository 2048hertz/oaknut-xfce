README for xfce version 4.4.x
=============================

WHAT IS IT ?
------------
'xfce4-panel' is the panel of the Xfce Desktop Environment. It is no longer 
modeled after the CDE panel like the first versions of xfce.
This version is based on GTK2 and should have all the advantages that come 
with this toolkit (see http://www.gtk.org).

The panel provides program lauchers with, optionally, non-hierarchical menus 
(easier to read at a glance), and several panel 'plugins' like a clock and a
pager. Additional plugins may be installed separately.
