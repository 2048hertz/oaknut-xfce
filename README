README for xfce version 4.4.x
=============================

WHAT IS IT ?
------------
'xfce4-panel' is the panel of the Xfce Desktop Environment. It is modeled
slightly after the CDE panel and, of course, previous versions of xfce.
This version is based on GTK2 and should have all the advantages that come 
with this new and improved toolkit (see http://www.gtk.org).

The panel provides program lauchersi with optional, non-hierarchical menus 
(easier to read at a glance), and several panel 'plugins' like a clock and a
pager. Additional plugins may be installed separately.


WHAT'S NEW ?
------------
Apart from the toolkit changes the underlying framework of the panel has also
changed completely. 

All interactions with the window manager take place through the new window
manager hints as defined on http://www.freedesktop.org. This means that you 
will need a compliant window manager for xfce to function properly (preferably 
xfwm4 ;-).

Highlights from the new panel include:
o vertical and horizontal mode
o icon themes
o dynamic modules as well as traditional launcher buttons
o support for multiple panels
o plugins can be loadable modules or external programs
