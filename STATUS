Status Xfce Panel
=================

New features
------------
- Plugins can run both internal and external without recompiling.
  External plugins now run inside a wrapper program. As a result
  a lot of code has been removed from libxfce4panel.


Bugs Fixed
----------
692  : Corner offset of panels. Panels can now be moved and
       locked in any position.
1933 : Panel Grows and shrinks from the center. You can
       also snap a panel on an screen edge.
2203 : Arbitrarily resizable panels.
2465 : Normal Width also applies to height. This feature has
       been removed.
2471 : Hidden panel doesn't grow. The hidden window is now
       also properly allocated when the window is hidden.
2955 : Then opening the properties or add items dialog it
       appears on the correct screen.
3748 : Panel desn't pick up changes made with XRandr. The
       monitor configuration is no longer stored and recalculated
       when the screen size or monitor number changes (GTK+ 2.14).
